-making P2P payments  $$$$$

-gives you a ticker chart for any stock or cryptocurrency that you would like by gettting live feeds from various API’s (ADD CHARTS)

-Makes you a crypto wallet on the Ethereum blockchain, giving you control of your private keys  $$$$

//-Portfolio of stocks and tokens to track and by making a query, you can add a new one to your portfolio and then be able to quickly access data for it (Portfolio page)

-getting other information such as volume and other market indicators like MACD and volatility, (CHART AND MACD, volatility)


Not possible with deadline/scope creep

-the ability to get an alert whenever a certain stock or cryptocurrency hits a certain threshold, (MAYBE)

-the ability to get daily price alerts for a certain stock or crypto and the ability to execute a trade on my account based on certain indicators using my trading account’s API  ()

-The novelty of this application is that since we are using data from different blockchains, we will be getting accurate price info and address right off the blockchain in a decentralized way, not having to rely on a company’s API.
